## Hey!

I hope you used the link to come here!

## Test: Relativity

Running `find . -name '*.md'` will probably show something like this:

```bash
./index.md
./relTest2.md
./folder/folder/relTest1.md
```
Since we are in `relTest1.md`, and want to reach `relTest2.md`, we need to go two folders up.

This link should work: [go to reltest2](../../relTest2.md)
